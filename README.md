This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Awesome-10-20
A curated awesome 10-20 list in any field.

## The Goal
> The goal of this project/platform is to provide a very interactive space/platform for information seekers. For someone who needs help in any field.

Main purpose of this app would be to provide support to all developers by guiding them what they should do and connecting them with the community.

#### For example
> If a student(RV) who is an intermediate python developer who wants to work in open source as a contributor on an intermediate python project. But the student doesn't know how to contribute in open-source and he also doesn't know how to search for an intermediate python project in open source.

#### How this platform helps
> Student(RV) have two doubts i) How to work in open source and ii) Need an intermediate python project to contribute.

So when RV came to Awesome 10-20 platform boot asked some questions related to his query.
Your field of interest with relevant options

- Open Source
- Python
- Web
- iOS
- ML

> iF RV select open Source then bot again respond with some options (solution)

- Awesome 10-20 videos on open source
- Awesome 10-20 blogs on how to work in open source
- Awesome 10-20 List of websites of open source
- Awesome 10-20 List to open source projects

This is the path of Awesome 10-20 platform to get best help with high interactive space.<br>
Awesome 10-20 content is a top rated collection in tech space.
